### Dan Dascalescu

This is my personal profile, where I keep my main projects and repos. (I'm currently sorting through them, and adding old projects, so it's a bit barren at the moment)  
  
Highlights:
 - [Film Ratings App](https://github.com/ddascalescu/app-film-ratings) - simple Flutter (Dart) app for analysing film ratings
 - [Ad Auction Dashboard](https://github.com/dandascalescu-old/ad-auction-dashboard/tree/staging) - old Java applet for data analysis (note: final branch was staging, not master)
 - [Helpful things](https://github.com/ddascalescu/helpful-things) - my personal knowledge base
